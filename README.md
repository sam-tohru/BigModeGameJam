# BigModeGameJam
This was made in 2 weeks using Godot 4, for the BigMode Game Jam, the themeofthe jam being "mode"
There's 2 states, a 'Small Mode' where you're tiny, needing to complete orders by encircling materials, this makes your clothes for the next mode.
You grow into a 'Big Mode' where you're on a fashion show, and you do poses to collect points.

There's some stuff I ran out of time with during this 2 week game-jam, but I think it turned out pretty well, it's a web-game at: https://kobemano.itch.io/little-stitches
